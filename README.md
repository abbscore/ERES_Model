# 🌟 **ERES Model**

## 📘 **Overview**
**The Ensemble-Based Risk Estimation System (ERES)** is a machine learning model developed to predict **postoperative mortality risk** in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Designed to enhance and potentially replace the traditional **EuroSCORE** system, this model specifically targets patients undergoing **coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve surgery**.

## 📊 **Dataset**
The model is based on a retrospective analysis of **543 patients**, utilizing preoperative clinical data. The dataset includes demographic information, clinical characteristics, and preoperative laboratory results of the patients.

## 🔑 **Features**
**ERES** incorporates significant clinical parameters such as **creatinine level**, **age**, and **left ventricular ejection fraction**. The model utilizes **15 key features** to demonstrate superior predictive performance.

## ⚙️ **Model Usage**
**ERES** offers a more accurate estimation of mortality risks for patients.  
📌 *For a detailed understanding of the model’s application, please refer to the **flowchart** provided in this repository, which guides through the model's workflow and implementation steps.*

## 📈 **Performance Evaluation**
The model has been evaluated using various machine learning algorithms and compared with the **EuroSCORE I model**.  
📊 *ERES has been assessed through **calibration plots** and **ROC curve analysis**, showcasing advanced prediction capabilities and suitability for clinical use.*
