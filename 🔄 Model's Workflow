# 🔄 **Model's Workflow**

The workflow of the **ERES Model** follows a structured pipeline to ensure accurate risk estimation in cardiac surgery patients. Below is an overview of the step-by-step process:

## 📌 **Workflow Steps**
1. **🛠 Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature selection  
   - Normalization of numerical variables  

2. **📊 Feature Engineering**  
   - Identifying key risk factors  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Scaling and transformation  

3. **🤖 Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Training models using ML algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.)  
   - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning  
   - Model calibration and performance assessment  

4. **📈 Performance Metrics**  
   - ROC-AUC and calibration plots  
   - Brier Score for risk estimation  
   - Decision Curve Analysis (DCA)  

5. **📥 Deployment & Integration**
